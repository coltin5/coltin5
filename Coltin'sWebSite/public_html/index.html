                        <h1>Introduction:</h1>
                        <p>There are many approches to understand the world around us and how we, as humans, interact within, and decode it. 
                        The Eight Circuit Model of human consciosness was originally developed by Harvard Professor and icon of the 60's: Timonth Leary
                         and later was expanded upon by Robert Anton Wilson. This App was created to dive into this model of reality and provide a map
                        for human consciousness. Remember that the map is never the actual territory and this is only a model!</p>

                        <h3>The Survival Circuit</h3>
                        <p>The most basic of human instincts is to survive, without this circuit, humans would have not lasted very long. 
                            This circuit is concerned with nourishment, physical safety, comfort and survival, suckling, cuddling, etc. 
                            It begins with one spatial dimension, forward/back. A positive imprint in this circuit sets up a basic attitude of trust.
                            A negative imprint sets up a basic attitude of suspicion.

                        <h3>The Emotional/Territorial Circuit</h3>
                        <p>Leary referred to this circuit as the Emotional-Locomotion Circuit and Wilson called it the Anal-Terrorial Circuit. 
                            This circuit is imprinted in the toddler stage. It is concerned with domination and submission, territoriality, etc.
                            The imprint on this circuit will trigger one of two states: </p>
                            <p>Dominant, aggressive behavior. This imprint creates an 'alpha' social attitude. 
                            Equivalent to the 'top dog' position in the model of Fritz Perls, to 'I'm OK' in the 'life positions' model of Transactional analysis, 
                            and to master morality in the model of Friedrich Nietzsche.</p><p>
                            Submissive, cooperative behavior. Equivalent to the 'bottom dog' position in the model of Fritz Perls, to 'I'm not OK' in the life 
                            positions model and to Nietzschean "slave morality".</p>

                        <p>Leary called this the Laryngeal-Manual Symbolic Circuit and Wilson the Semantic Time-Binding Circuit[19] This circuit is imprinted 
                            by human symbol systems. It is concerned with language, handling the environment, invention, calculation, prediction, building a 
                            mental "map" of the universe and physical dexterity.</p>

                        <p>Leary called this the Socio-Sexual Domstication Circuit and Wilson the Socio-Sexual Circuit. This fourth circuit is imprinted 
                            by the first orgasm-mating experiences and local tribal moral standards. It is concerned with sexual pleasure 
                            (instead of sexual reproduction), local definitions of "moral" and "immoral", reproduction, rearing of the young, etc. 
                            The fourth circuit concerns itself with cultural values and operating within social networks. This circuit is said to have 
                            first appeared with the development of tribes.</p>

                        <h2>Fifth Circuit:</h2>
                        <h3>The Neurosomatic Circuit</h3>
                        <p>This circuit, called the Neurosomatic Circuit, is concerned with neurological-somatic feedbacks, feeling high and blissful, 
                            somatic reprogramming, etc. It may be called the rapture circuit. When this circuit is activated, a 
                            non-conceptual feeling of well-being arises. This has a beneficial effect on the health of the physical body. 
                            The fifth circuit is consciousness of the body. There is a marked shift from linear visual space to an all-encompassing 
                            aesthetic sensory space. Perceptions are judged not so much for their meaning and utility, but for their aesthetic qualities. 
                            Experience of this circuit often accompanies an hedonistic turn-on, a rapturous amusement, a detachment from the previously 
                            compulsive mechanism of the first four circuits.</p>

                        <h2>Sixth Circuit:</h2>
                        <h3>The Neurogenetic Circuit</h3>
                        <p>Leary referred to this as the Neurogenetic Circuit. Wilson called this the Morphogenetic Circuit. (Wilson here, made reference to Rupert 
                            Sheldrake's morphogenesis theory.) This circuit is the connection of the individual's mind to the whole sweep of evolution and life as a whole. 
                            It is the part of consciousness that echoes the experiences of the previous generations that have brought the individual's brain-mind to its present level. 
                            It deals with ancestral, societal and scientific DNA-RNA-brain feedbacks. Those who achieve this mutation may speak of past lives, reincarnation, 
                            immortality etc. It corresponds to the collective unconscious in the models of Carl Jung where archetypes reside. Activation of this circuit 
                            may be equated with consciousness of the Great God Pan in his aspect of Life as a whole, or with consciousness of the Gaia, in which the biosphere 
                            is considered as a single organism. The circuit, according to the model, first appeared among the Hindus in the early first millennium and later 
                            reappeared amongst Sufi sects.</p>

                        <h3>The Meta-Programming Circuit</h3>
                        <p>Leary labelled this the Neuro-Electric Circuit and Wilon called this the Metaprogramming Circuit. Timothy Leary listed this circuit as the sixth, 
                            and the neurogenetic circuit as the seventh. In his Prometheus Rising, Wilson reversed the order of these two circuits, and described neurogenetic 
                            circuit as the sixth circuit, and the metaprogramming circuit as the seventh. In Quantum Psychology, published later, Wilson reverted the order 
                            back to Leary's original schema.</p>

                        <h2>Eighth Circuit:</h2>
                        <h3>The Non-Local Circuit</h3>
                        <p>Leary referred to this as the Neuro-Atomic Metaphysiology and Wilson as the Non-Local Quantum Circuit. The eighth circuit is concerned 
                            with quantum consciousness, non-local awareness (information from beyond ordinary space-time awareness which is limited by the speed of light), illumination.
                            This circuit has even been compared to the Buddhist concept of Indra's net from the Avatamsaka Sutra.
